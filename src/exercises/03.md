# React.memo for reducing unnecessary re-renders

## Personal Notes

-   Here we see an example of `React.memo()` vs `React.useMemo()`
    -   `React.memo()` is used for components (works like an HOC), `useMemo()` is not
    -   `const EnhancedComponent = React.memo(Component[, compareProps])` where by default, React will shallow-compare the props to determine if it should re-render the Component, but you can provide your own `function(prevProps, nextProps) => boolean` if you want to customize the comparison
-   It's a mistake to _blindly_ apply `React.memo()` all over the place thinking it'll optimize your app; it _can_ make your app faster, but it can make it a lot more complex as well because the memoization ends-up having very long tenticles...
-   Performance optimizations almost always come with a complexity cost, so make sure the added complexity is worth it
-   You can memoize a third-party component by wrapping it yourself into `React.memo()`

## Background

Here's the lifecycle of a React app:

```
â†’  render â†’ reconcilitation â†’ commit
         â†–                   â†™
              state change
```

Let's define a few terms:

- The "render" phase: create React elements React.createElement
- The "reconciliation" phase: compare previous elements with the new ones
- The "commit" phase: update the DOM (if needed).

React exists in its current form (in large part) because updating the DOM is the
slowest part of this process. By separating us from the DOM, React can perform
the most surgically optimal updates to the DOM to speed things up for us
big-time.

A React Component can re-render for any of the following reasons:

1. Its props change
2. Its internal state changes
3. It is consuming context values which have changed
4. Its parent re-renders

React is really fast, however, _sometimes_ it can be useful to give React little
tips about certain parts of the React tree when there's a state update. You can
opt-out of state updates for a part of the React tree by using one of React's
built-in rendering bail-out utilities: `React.PureComponent`, `React.memo`, or
`shouldComponentUpdate`.

I want to emphasize that I've seen many projects make the mistake of using these
utilities as band-aids over more problematic performance problems in their apps.
Please read more about this in my blog post:
[Fix the slow render before you fix the re-render](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-slow-render-before-you-fix-the-re-render).

Let's look at an example to learn how this works. You can pull this example up
at http://localhost:3000/isolated/examples/unnecessary-rerenders (and feel free
to play with it in `src/examples/unnecessary-rerenders.js`). Pull this up and
profile it with the React DevTools.

```jsx
function CountButton({count, onClick}) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{count}</button>
}

function NameInput({name, onNameChange}) {
  return (
    <label>
      Name: <input value={name} onChange={e => onNameChange(e.target.value)} />
    </label>
  )
}

function Example() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('')
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <CountButton count={count} onClick={increment} />
      </div>
      <div>
        <NameInput name={name} onNameChange={setName} />
      </div>
      {name ? <div>{`${name}'s favorite number is ${count}`}</div> : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Based on how this is implemented, when you click on the counter button, the
`<CountButton />` re-renders (so we can update the `count` value). But the
`<NameInput />` is also re-rendered. If you have
`Record why each component rendered while profiling.` enabled in React DevTools,
then you'll see that under "Why did this render?" it says "The parent component
rendered."

React does this because it has no way of knowing whether the NameInput will need
to return different React elements based on the state change of it's parent. In
our case there were no changes necessary, so React didn't bother updating the
DOM. This is what's called an "unnecessary rerender" and if that
render/reconciliation process is expensive, then it can be worthwhile to prevent
it.

Using one of the bail-out APIs, you can instruct React when to re-render.
`React.PureComponent` is for class components and `React.memo` is for function
components and they do basically the same thing by default. They make it so your
component will not re-render simply because its parent re-rendered which could
improve the performance of your app overall.

So here's how we can improve our example:

```jsx
const CountButton = React.memo(function CountButton({count, onClick}) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{count}</button>
})

const NameInput = React.memo(function NameInput({name, onNameChange}) {
  return (
    <label>
      Name: <input value={name} onChange={e => onNameChange(e.target.value)} />
    </label>
  )
})

// etc... no other changes necessary
```

If you try that out, then you'll notice the `<NameInput />` no longer re-renders
when you click on the counter button, saving React the work of having to call
the `NameInput` function and compare the previous react elements with the new
ones.

Again, I want to mention that people can make the mistake of wrapping
_everything_ in `React.memo` which can actually slow down your app in some cases
and in all cases it makes your code more complex. So it's much better to use it
more intentionally and further, there are other things you can do to reduce the
amount of unnecessary re-renders throughout your application (which we'll talk
about more later).

## Exercise

In this exercise, pull up the React DevTools and observe when you click the
"force rerender" button, the `Downshift`, `Menu`, and `ListItem` components are
all re-rendered even though no DOM updates were needed. This is an unnecessary
re-render and a bottleneck in our application (especially if we want to start
showing all of the results rather than just the first 100... I've heard rumors
that the product manager ðŸ•´ wants us to do that). If you enable 6x throttle on
the CPU (under the Performance tab in Chrome DevTools) then you'll notice the
issue is more stark.

Your job is to optimize the `Menu` and `ListItem` components to be memoized via
`React.memo`. Make note of the before/after render times.

### ðŸ’¯ Memoize the Downshift component

This one's a little trickier, but the Downshift library is not using
`React.memo` or `PureComponent`. See if you can figure out how to optimize it
anyway.
