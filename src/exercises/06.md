# Optimize context value

## Personal Notes

-   In this particular exercise, we see a good combination of `React.useMemo()` to memoize the state, and `React.memo()` to memoize the children
-   Not memoizing the children, and just the state, would not improve performance; both must be used in this case to avoid children re-rendering unnecessarily
-   Separating the `state` and `dispatch()` from `React.useReducer()` is an effective way of avoiding re-renders in components that just need the `dispatch()` and not the state, since the dispatch method never changes for the lifetime of the app
    -   Create separate contexts, one for state, one for dispatch, and use only the one you need (or both if you need both)

## Background

The way that context works is that whenever the provided value changes from one
render to another, it triggers a re-render of all the consuming components
(which will re-render whether or not they're memoized).

So take this for example:

```jsx
const CountContext = React.createContext()

function CountProvider(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const value = [count, setCount]
  return <CountContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}
```

Every time the `<CountProvider />` is re-rendered, the `value` is brand new, so
even though the `count` value itself may stay the same, all component consumers
will be re-rendered.

This can be problematic in certain scenarios. You can read more about this here:

The quick and easy solution to this problem is to memoize the value that you
provide to the context provider:

```jsx
const CountContext = React.createContext()

function CountProvider(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const value = React.useMemo(() => [count, setCount], [count])
  return <CountContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}
```

## Exercise

After we fixed the previous performance problem, our ðŸ•´ product manager noticed
another performance problem. Whenever you click on the "force render" button
it's slow. See if you can figure out why and fix that by memoizing the context
value.

Make sure to profile before/after to see whether you actually fixed the problem.

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ separate the contexts

After we fixed that performance problem with our app, the ðŸ•´ product manager was
so happy because it was fast enough to add a new feature to the grid. Now you
can update a single cell by clicking on it. But there's a performance problem
with that as well. Every single cell in the grid re-renders when we do that. Not
just the one that was changed!

The reason this is happening is because all the cells consume the provider value
and when the state changes, they need to be re-rendered. But wait... they don't
really depend on the part of the value that's changing, right? They only need
the `dispatch` function. So what if we put the state in one context provider and
the `dispatch` function in another context provider? Hmm.... Give that a try and
see if you can get things to run faster.
